## What is Docker?

Docker is a platform that makes it easy to run applications in isolated containers. Think of containers as lightweight, standalone packages that include everything needed to run a piece of software.

## Why Docker?

- **Easy Setup**: No need to manually install each application
- **No Conflicts**: Each service runs in its own container, preventing conflicts
- **Simple Updates**: Update any service with just two commands
- **Consistent Environment**: Works the same way on any computer or OS
- **Resource Efficient**: Uses fewer resources than running everything directly on your system
- **Easy Backup**: All configurations are in one place
- **Quick Recovery**: If something breaks, just restart the container

This stack uses Docker Compose, a tool that helps you run multiple Docker containers together. Instead of managing each service separately, you can start/stop/update everything with single commands.

## Quick Start

1. Install Docker and Docker Compose
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/flyryan/MediaServerCompose.git
   cd MediaServerCompose
   ```
3. Set up Mullvad VPN (see [VPN Setup](#vpn-setup))
4. Update paths in `docker-compose.yml` (see [Configuration](#configuration))
5. Create the required directories:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p {plex,radarr,sonarr,overseerr,tautulli,jackett,sabnzbd,organizr,monitorr,netdata,speedtest-tracker,qbt}/config backup
   ```
6. Start everything:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

That's it! Your media server is now running. Continue reading for detailed setup and configuration instructions.

## Architecture Overview

The media server stack is built with a microservices architecture where each component runs in its own Docker container, working together to provide a complete media management and streaming solution. Here's how everything fits together:

### Core Components

#### Media Management Layer
- **Plex Media Server**: The central media streaming service
  - Handles transcoding and streaming to various devices
  - Manages media libraries and metadata
  - Supports multiple users with different permissions
  - Can utilize GPU acceleration for faster transcoding

#### Request & Discovery System
- **Overseerr**: Front-end request management system
  - Provides user-friendly interface for media requests
  - Integrates with Plex for library awareness
  - Forwards requests to appropriate services (Radarr/Sonarr)
  - Manages user permissions and request quotas

#### Automated Media Acquisition
- **Radarr** (Movies) & **Sonarr** (TV Shows): Automated media managers
  - Monitor for wanted media
  - Handle quality profiles and upgrades
  - Manage media organization and naming
  - Integrate with download clients and indexers

#### Download Management
- **Gluetun**: VPN Gateway
  - Routes specified container traffic through VPN
  - Provides secure connection via WireGuard
  - Enables port forwarding for better connectivity
  - Protects privacy for downloading operations

- **qBittorrent**: Torrent download manager
  - Runs through VPN tunnel (Gluetun)
  - Handles torrent downloads with encryption
  - Includes automatic RAR extraction
  - Manages download queues and priorities

- **SABnzbd**: Usenet downloader
  - Handles Usenet binary downloads
  - Automated file repair and extraction
  - SSL encryption for secure downloads
  - Bandwidth scheduling and management

#### Search & Indexing
- **Jackett**: Torrent indexer proxy
  - Unifies multiple torrent sites
  - Provides standardized search API
  - Manages tracker credentials
  - Converts searches to site-specific formats

### Monitoring & Management

#### System Monitoring
- **Monitorr**: Service status dashboard
  - Monitors all services' health
  - Provides uptime tracking
  - Alerts on service failures
  - Shows quick status overview

- **Netdata**: System metrics collection
  - Real-time performance monitoring
  - Resource usage tracking
  - Network statistics
  - Historical data analysis

#### Media Analytics
- **Tautulli**: Plex usage statistics
  - Tracks media plays and user activity
  - Generates viewing statistics
  - Monitors transcoding sessions
  - Provides notification system

#### Network Performance
- **OpenSpeedTest**: Network speed testing
  - Local speed test server
  - Bandwidth measurement
  - Latency testing
  - Cross-platform compatibility

- **SpeedTest Tracker**: Speed monitoring
  - Automated speed tests
  - Historical speed data
  - Performance trending
  - Network reliability metrics

#### Service Organization
- **Organizr**: Unified web interface
  - Single sign-on capability
  - Customizable dashboard
  - Service iframe integration
  - Access management

### Data Flow

1. **Media Request Flow**:
   ```
   User ‚Üí Overseerr ‚Üí Radarr/Sonarr ‚Üí Jackett ‚Üí Download Clients ‚Üí Media Library ‚Üí Plex
   ```

2. **Download Security Flow**:
   ```
   Internet ‚Üî Gluetun (VPN) ‚Üî qBittorrent ‚Üî Local Storage
   ```

3. **Streaming Flow**:
   ```
   Media Files ‚Üí Plex ‚Üí Transcoding (if needed) ‚Üí User Devices
   ```

### Security Considerations

- All torrent traffic is routed through VPN (Gluetun)
- Services can be exposed securely via Cloudflare Tunnels
- Internal services are not directly exposed to the internet
- Each service runs with specific user permissions
- Container isolation prevents service interference

### Integration Points
- All services share a common Docker network
- Consistent UID/GID across containers
- Shared storage volumes for media
- Standardized timezone settings
- Unified monitoring and logging

## Detailed Setup Guide

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Docker**
   - [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/)
   - [macOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/)
   - [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

   Note: For ARM64 systems (like Apple M1/M2 or Raspberry Pi), most images are compatible but some may require specific ARM64 versions. Check the docker-compose.yml for platform-specific image tags.

2. **Install Docker Compose**
   - Usually included with Docker Desktop (Windows/macOS)
   - [Linux installation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### VPN Setup

This stack uses Mullvad VPN to protect your privacy. Here's how to set it up:

1. Sign up at [Mullvad VPN](https://mullvad.net)

2. Generate a WireGuard configuration:
   - Go to [Mullvad Account](https://mullvad.net/en/account/#/wireguard-config)
   - Select "Linux" as your platform
   - Generate a new key
   - Download the configuration file

3. From the configuration file, you'll need:
   - `PrivateKey` from the [Interface] section
   - `Address` from the [Interface] section (e.g., 10.x.x.x/32)

### Configuration

1. **Find your user/group IDs**:
   ```bash
   # Run these commands to get your user and group IDs:
   echo "Your PUID is: $(id -u)"
   echo "Your PGID is: $(id -g)"
   ```
   Note: These IDs are critical for proper file permissions. All services must use the same PUID/PGID values to ensure consistent access to media files. Common values are PUID=1000 and PGID=1000 for the first user created on Linux systems.

2. **Set your timezone**:
   - Find your timezone from the [TZ database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones)
   - Example: `America/New_York`, `Europe/London`
   Note: Some systems may require admin/sudo access to modify timezone settings. If you encounter permission errors, prefix commands with sudo.

3. **Update docker-compose.yml**:
   - Replace all `PUID` and `PGID` values with yours
   - Replace all `TZ` values with your timezone
   - Set your media paths in docker-compose.yml:
     ```yaml
     # Replace these example paths with your actual media directories:
     /path/to/movies     # Where you want to store movies
     /path/to/tv        # Where you want to store TV shows
     /path/to/downloads # Where temporary downloads are stored
     /path/to/backup    # Where configuration backups are stored
     ```
   - Add your Mullvad configuration:
     ```yaml
     WIREGUARD_PRIVATE_KEY: your_private_key_here
     WIREGUARD_ADDRESSES: your_wireguard_address_here
     SERVER_CITIES: los_angeles # Use lowercase with underscores, e.g., new_york, london, tokyo
     ```
