## What is Docker?

Docker is a platform that makes it easy to run applications in isolated containers. Think of containers as lightweight, standalone packages that include everything needed to run a piece of software.

## Why Docker?

- **Easy Setup**: No need to manually install each application
- **No Conflicts**: Each service runs in its own container, preventing conflicts
- **Simple Updates**: Update any service with just two commands
- **Consistent Environment**: Works the same way on any computer or OS
- **Resource Efficient**: Uses fewer resources than running everything directly on your system
- **Easy Backup**: All configurations are in one place
- **Quick Recovery**: If something breaks, just restart the container

This stack uses Docker Compose, a tool that helps you run multiple Docker containers together. Instead of managing each service separately, you can start/stop/update everything with single commands.

## Quick Start

1. Install Docker and Docker Compose
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/flyryan/MediaServerCompose.git
   cd MediaServerCompose
   ```
3. Set up Mullvad VPN (see [VPN Setup](#vpn-setup))
4. Update paths in `docker-compose.yml` (see [Configuration](#configuration))
5. Create the required directories:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p {plex,radarr,sonarr,overseerr,tautulli,jackett,sabnzbd,organizr,monitorr,netdata,speedtest-tracker,qbt}/config
   ```
6. Start everything:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

That's it! Your media server is now running. Continue reading for detailed setup and configuration instructions.
